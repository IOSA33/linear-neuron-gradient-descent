# linear-neuron-gradient-descent

Simple linear regression and gradient descent by training a single artificial neuron from scratch using Go.

## Description

This project implements a simple linear neuron with:
- **One input (X)**
- **One output (YÌ‚)**
- **Trainable parameters:** weight (W) and bias (b)
- **Loss function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimization:** Gradient Descent

The goal is to train the neuron so that it approximates the target value **Y** as close as possible, given a known input **X**.
